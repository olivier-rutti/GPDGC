* INTRODUCTION

  Libgpdgc is a library providing group communication abstractions that are
  tolerant to byzanzine faults (e.g., malicious processes).
  Therefore, libgpdgc can be used to build fault tolerant distributed systems.

  Libgpdgc is Free Software (meaning that it respects your freedom). It
  can be freely used, modified and distributed under the terms of the
  GNU Affero General Public License.


* BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

  Libgpdbc depends on the following Gnu packages:

    glib-2.0     (https://developer.gnome.org/glib/)
    libgcrypt    (https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/libgcrypt/)

  You should get the latest versions of course, the Libgpdgc configure
  script complains if a version is not sufficient.

  After building and installing the above packages, you may continue with
  installation. As with all packages, you just have to do

    ./configure
    make
    make install


* DOCUMENTATION

  The complete documentation is in the texinfo manual named
  `gpdgc.info'.  Run "info gpdgc" to read it.  If you want a a
  printable copy of the manual, change to the "doc" directory and
  enter "make pdf" For a HTML version enter "make html" and point your
  browser to gpdgc.html/index.html.
